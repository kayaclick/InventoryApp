# InventoryApp

This app is a basic inventory managment / checkout app targeted towards small businesses. As I will be publishing it for free on the app store the code is open. It is 100% local data storage which obviously has its downsides but means I dont have to maintain servers and create the back end for an account system as well. 


It has the ability to set par levels for items, prices, scanning barcodes to add new items (which will auto populate the data for the fields as best as it can) and quickly change item counts by scanning already existing items with the options on the scan screen. It will also have features such as item history so you can see how your counts changed for x item over time, and some very basic reports.
